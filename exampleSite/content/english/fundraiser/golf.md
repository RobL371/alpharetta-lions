### Upcoming Event: Alpharetta Lions Club 2022 Charity Golf Tournament

Stay tuned for information and dates for our 2022 event.  For sponsorship information, contact Bill Requa at golf@alpharettalions.com.

### Past Event: Alpharetta Lions Club 2021 Charity Golf Tournament

The Alpharetta Lions Club is hosting its annual charity golf tournament on September 27th at the Crooked 
Creek Golf Club.  Format will be a four-person "Texas Shamble" with a shotgun start at 9:00 am.  Individual 
players and twosomes will be paired with players of similar skill levels or interests whenever possible.

*In a Shamble each golfer tees off on every hole. The team then selects their best drive and each team member 
plays their second shot from there. After the second shot each golfer plays their own ball for the remainder 
of the hole. For example, players A & B are on a team, both A & B tee off, A hit the better drive so they select 
to take their second shot from A's spot, both A & B hit from A's spot, and play their own balls throughout the 
rest of the hole.*

Play will be immediately followed by free beer and gourmet hotdogs at the clubhouse, along with the 
awarding of prizes and a silent auction featuring a large array of desirable items.

Proceeds from this year's tournament will be shared between the Georgia Lions Lighthouse Foundation (which
provides vision and hearing services through education, detection, prevention, and treatment) and the Jeffrey
Evans Transplant House (which provides living accommodations near Emory Hospital for patients, with their
parent, spouse, or caregiver) who are awaiting or recovering from major transplant surgery.
