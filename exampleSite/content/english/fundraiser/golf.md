The Alpharetta Lions Club is hosting its annual charity golf tournament on September 27th at the Crooked 
Creek Golf Club.  Format will be a four-person "Texas Shamble" with a shotgun start at 9:00 am.  Individual 
players and twosomes will be paired with players of similar skill levels or interests whenever possible.

Play will be immediately followed by free beer and gourmet hotdogs at the clubhouse, along with the 
awarding of prizes and a silent auction featuring a large array of desirable items.

Proceeds from this year's tournament will be shared between the Georgia Lions Lighthouse Foundation (which
provides vision and hearing services through education, detection, prevention, and treatment) and the Jeffrey
Evans Transplant House (which provides living accommodations near Emory Hospital for patients, with their
parent, spouse, or caregiver) who are awaiting or recovering from major transplant surgery.

See our [online store](https://alpharetta-lions-club.square.site/shop/golf2021/3) to see ways local businesses,
organizations, and individuals can participate in this worthwhile project.  We ask that you help us and your 
community by ecoming a sponsor, donating an auction item or prize, having an ad in the brochure, and/or by 
joining a foursome for a fun day of golf.

For more information about playing or sponsoring, contact us at golf@alpharettalions.com.
