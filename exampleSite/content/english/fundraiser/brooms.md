Periodically, our club sells brooms at local markets.  This helps to raise funds while simultaneously raising the Lions' visibility to the community.

We do not currently ship brooms.  However, if you are local and are interested in buying brooms, or if you are hosting a market where the club could have a booth, please contact us at brooms@alpharettalions.com.
