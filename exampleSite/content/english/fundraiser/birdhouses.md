Our club has started selling blue bird houses and feeders. They're very easy to clean and very well built by our own Mark Pamperin.


Available in pine or cedar.  You can also get a pole to hang it from.  An amazing gift for Mother's Day! Also available: Kits with assembly instructions.  Excellent gift for kid's birthdays or Christmas!

###### To order, or for more information, email birdhouse@alpharettalions.com.
