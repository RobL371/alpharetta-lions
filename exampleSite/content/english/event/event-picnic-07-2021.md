### Wills Park at 4pm!

Annual picnic at Wills Park Pavilion.
We'll eat at 5:00 pm. $10.00 per person.
Volunteers needed to cook, setup and clean up.
We'll cook hamburgers and hotdogs. Please bring a covered dish.
Also bring quarters. They'll be donated to United Military Care.
This is a great opportunity to bring prospective members and
show them what a good time we have as a group and talk to them
about who we are and what we do.

*This will take the place of the regular July meeting.*
