#### MD 18 Centennial 2021 State Convention, June 4-6, 2021 at the Sheraton Hotel Atlanta.

Our city looks forward to welcoming all members from around our great state after a long time of not being able to be with our fellow Lions, Lionesses, and Leos. 

**Guest Speaker: 2nd International Vice President, Brian Sheehan.** Let's show IVP Brian a large Georgia welcome by packing the convention with as many Georgia Lions as possible.
 
The official convention dates are June 4, 5, and 6. Anyone participating in the final Council of Governors work session must also be present on Thursday, June 3.

Should you have further questions or need assistance in anyway, please contact PDG David White or PCC Garner Andrews at their contact information listed on the registration form.

 
#### Register By May 21 for best rate
**[Use the registration form for your completion and return.](https://files.constantcontact.com/34de936a601/a974a013-bdde-4908-a991-04362876cc01.pdf)** Registration deadline is May 21, 2021 in order to take advantage of special savings for registering early.  Please forward your check to our Registration Chairman, PDG David White, at address shown on form.  

For those who registered for the 2020 convention and chose not to have your funds returned, you are still registered. PDG David White can confirm if you are on that list. **The only thing we would ask, is that due to continued rising food prep costs related to COVID, that you consider sending an additional $25.00 to PDG David to help defray some of these costs.**

**Interested in a vendor table?**  [Use this registration form](https://files.constantcontact.com/34de936a601/96eb466d-eabc-47e0-9422-a5399d4b0aa1.pdf).  There is a discount for clubs who are not selling items.

Our rates have not changed from last year, and they were able to give us a few rooms at an additional $10 discount ($115 instead of $125/night)!  These rates are good through May 24th.

#### Program Ads available

We are continuing the tradition of having individuals, clubs, and business [place ads in our program](https://files.constantcontact.com/34de936a601/7cb78a64-26a2-46af-b5b1-30c1a5041db8.pdf) to celebrate our Lions. This will be a VERY special edition of our state convention program, as it is our Centennial MD18 Convention. There will be a lot of additional special content in the program this year, making it a true collector's edition.
