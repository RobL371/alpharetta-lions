**On Friday, June 11, 2021 through Thursday, June 17, 2021, the Officers and Board members of Lions Clubs International will be arriving, meeting, and departing from Atlanta. As the hosts for this event, we are calling for volunteers!**

We will need assistance for the following committees:

* **The Airport Welcoming Committee:** welcoming the attendees at Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport at both the domestic and international terminals. The attendees will be arriving on Friday, June 11 and Saturday, June 12 so the welcoming committee's work will be done at that time. We will have more specifics once we receive the attendees' flight schedules in May.  

* **The Hotel Welcoming Committee:** welcoming the attendees to the Atlanta Hyatt Regency, providing them with local information, and assisting them with luggage (as there are no bellhops available at the hotel). [It would be great for some of our Leos to assist with this]. We will need at least two volunteers for each four hour shift for the information desk and at least two volunteers to fill each of two four hour shifts on Friday, June 11; Saturday, June 12; and two Thursday, June 17.

* **Coronavirus Safety Spotters Committee:** assisting Lions Clubs International Staff to encourage compliance with all COVID-19 protocols: wearing masks, maintaining social distancing. We need at least two per event, including the formal and informal Board meetings, the group events, and the off-site spouses' events. 

**All volunteers must sign the [COVID-19 Compliance Agreement](https://files.constantcontact.com/34de936a601/02624f41-681e-4909-bf56-d601eec4ccd0.pdf) (and either attach a vaccine card OR be tested for Covid-19 before and during before the Board meeting);** LCI will provide the testing supplies. All volunteers must also provide their name, cell phone number, email address, and physical mailing address. 
Please send your email of interest with your needed information and the COVID-19 Compliance Agreement to Council Chair Marlene Humphry at mhumphry@cox.net
