#### Top 3 reasons to attend the Lions event of the year
Virtual LCICon 2021 is gearing up to be the most exciting Lions Clubs International convention yet. There are many reasons you will not want to miss this premier Lions event taking place June 25-29. Here are the top three:

* A next-level celebration of service. LCICon 2021 is the first convention to be entirely hosted online, which means more Lions than ever before will be able to attend. And more Lions means more opportunities to connect and learn.

* Unique opportunities to engage with Lions. There will be numerous ways to share your club's story, interact with members from around the world, soak in the knowledge from seasoned Lions and be inspired by the next generation of leaders. In fact, you can even submit your story via video prior to the event. Some videos will be shared during convention!

* Content scheduling catered to your time zone. The mix of live and easy-access programming coupled with virtual exhibit booths and interactive opportunities gives you the freedom and flexibility to enjoy LCICon how and when you want.
