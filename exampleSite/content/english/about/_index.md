### About Alpharetta Lions

The Alpharetta Lions Club is one of over 48,000 Lions clubs worldwide. We have been serving our local community, our state, and the world since 1953. Pure and simple, our mission is to serve. Our focus is often on vision and hearing needs, but we offer assistance wherever we see a need.

Alpharetta Lions are an active group of fun-loving men and women serving North Fulton by improving conditions and providing opportunities for its citizens. Some of our many past and ongoing projects include:

* Youth eye screening
* Eye exams & glasses for the needy
* Eyeglasses collection and recycling
* Leader Dogs for the Blind
* Georgia Lions Camp
* Georgia Lions Lighthouse Foundation
* Alpharetta Public Safety Department:
    * First responder recognition
    * Kevlar vests for K-9s

We meet [monthly on the 4th Thursdays at Crooked Creek Clubhouse at 6:30 PM]({{< ref "event" >}}). Lions are service-minded men and women who are interested in improving their communities. We are young people, families, and baby boomers alike. To become a Lion is to become an active volunteer, a member of a respected international organization, a leader in your community, and a friend to people in need. Become involved...Become a Lion!
