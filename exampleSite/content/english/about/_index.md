## About Alpharetta Lions

The Alpharetta Lions Club is a part of Lions Club International.  Serving our community since 1953 with a focus on vision and hearing needs. We meet at 6:30 P.M. on the 4th Thursday at Crooked Creek Clubhouse.

Lions are groups of service-minded men and women who are interested in improving their communities. We are young people, families and Baby Boomers alike.
To become a Lion is to become an active volunteer, a member of a respected international organization, a leader in your community and a friend to people in need.
Become involved...Become a Lion!
