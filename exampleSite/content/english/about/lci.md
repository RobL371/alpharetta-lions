### About Lions Clubs International

[Lions Clubs International (LCI)](https://www.lionsclubs.org) is a global organization of volunteers dedicated to being the leader in community and humanitarian service, through the efforts of 48,000 clubs, 1.4 million members, in 210 nations. For over 100 years, Lions have been guided by our simple motto: "WE SERVE." Lions also believe young people are the leaders of tomorrow and today. Our Leo clubs give young people opportunities to become volunteers and service leaders, developing new skills and a lifelong passion for service. Approximately 180,000 Leos in 7,200 clubs are serving in more than 140 countries worldwide.

Mission Statement: To empower volunteers to serve their communities, meet humanitarian needs, encourage peace and promote international understanding through Lions clubs.

#### Lions Code of Ethics
* To show my faith in the worthiness of my vocation by industrious application to the end that I may merit a reputation for quality of service.
* To seek success and to demand all fair remuneration or profit as my just due, but to accept no profit or success at the price of my own self-respect lost because of unfair advantage taken or because of questionable acts on my part.
* To remember that in building up my business it is not necessary to tear down another's; to be loyal to my clients or customers and true to myself.
* Whenever a doubt arises as to the right or ethics of my position or action towards others, to resolve such doubt against myself.
* To hold friendship as an end and not a means. To hold that true friendship exists not on account of the service performed by one to another, but that true friendship demands nothing but accepts service in the spirit in which it is given.
* Always to bear in mind my obligations as a citizen to my nation, my state, and my community, and to give them my unswerving loyalty in word, act, and deed. To give them freely of my time, labor and means.
* To aid others by giving my sympathy to those in distress, my aid to the weak, and my substance to the needy.
* To be careful with my criticism and liberal with my praise; to build up and not destroy.

Worldwide LCI is rallying around five global causes related to vision, hunger, environment, childhood cancer, and diabetes. Through the Lions Clubs International Foundation more than US$1 billion has been issued in grants to support Lions' humanitarian projects. 

For example, Lions are committed to eliminate preventable blindness. Causes such as river blindness, vitamin deficiency, measles are well on their way to being totally eliminated. Lions are making a world of difference. There is no challenge that cannot be overcome when we unite for good.
