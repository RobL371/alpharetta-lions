Are you interested in Joining the Lions International Virtual Gaming Club? Fill out the form below!

*Note: The Alpharetta Lions Club have graciously allowed the Virtual Gaming Club to utilize their web site to gather applications while the gaming club gets their infrastructure setup.  The two clubs will be in the same Lions District (18-L) but are otherwise unrelated.*

By submitting this application and signing below, I accept membership into Lions Clubs International and that the standards are limited to persons of good moral character and reputation.  I recognize the importance of rendering personal service to my community in cooperation with other civic-minded persons.  I understand that the membership is not valid until approved by the clubs board of directors.
