### Setup at 12:30pm, Food ready at 4pm!

Annual picnic at Puckett's Place:  [7043 Campground Road, Cumming GA 30040](https://goo.gl/maps/tgY7SaFVDJHLby966)

$20.00 per person.  No charge for prospective members.

There is plenty to do either setting up, cooking, serving and cleanup.
Socializing is also a big part.

We realize the cost is higher this year. However, this is one of our larger more
expensive activities we do for ourselves. It’s also one of the best times to bring
your prospective members and we pay for their meal as a club. Should you have
any questions please don’t hesitate to contact us.

*RSVP before May 12, 2022 (before Dublin Convention, Tony will buy the shrimp
in Savannah. Need a head count so we’ll know how much to buy)*
